# Chrome-Research-Extension

Allows you to store search entries.

## Description

The inspiration to work on this project came from my lousy browsing habits. I'd often find myself creating new tabs to read up on definitions, names, or events, and end up leaving them open in the hopes of coming back to them later. Inevitably, these tabs pile up and I'd end up with a messy overloaded window, only to move on to the next, using the excuse of needing all this information eventually. To solve this, I thought an extension to easily add entries that I want to search, and store within the browser without opening any tabs, would solve my problem. The features of the extension include being able to add items, remove items, and a button to open the item pre-loaded in a google search tab (this deletes it from the extension) when the time comes, which helps keep the number of open tabs you have at once to a minimum. To allow for an even more seamless way to add text, Iâ€™ve made some progress to be able to highlight text and add it in one step through a right click menu, but it is not fully working yet (it works if you open the developer mode before trying).
